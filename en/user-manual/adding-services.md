# Adding Services

Here is where you will add a service that a customer can book for your company to render.

Let's add a service.

Timegrid will ask you for some information to create and add the service.

* **Service Name:** Name of the service your company will provide.
* **Duration in minutes:** Amount of time this service typically takes.
* **Description:** Description of the service. 

Once you have entered the required information, hit save to save the service to your business profile. 

Upon clicking on save, you will be brought to a new page where you will be provided with a confirmation that the service has been saved successfully and you can further edit the days of the week this service is provided.

Note: You may click "Get to Dashboard" to exit out of the "Add a service menu" and return to your business profile. Please note that by returning to your dashboard, any fields previously filled with information will NOT be saved to the service that was being created.
